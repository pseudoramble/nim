Nim
=============

Overview
-------------

Welcome to the game of Nim! This is actually a bit more like [Dr. Nim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KABcmczPdg) since it's a single-pile version of the game. 

Before looking it up online, or reading the source code, try the game out! 

Getting started
--------------

Clone this repo. Then, run an `npm install`. After that, an `npm start` or `npm run watch`.

You should be able to run the game in your browser on http://localhost:3141.

Why?
--------------

This was a quick repo to do two things:

1. Implement an entertaining game. I was inspired after having [seen this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KABcmczPdg). It reminded me of learning the game a long time ago.
2. Work out why a module bundler is useful. I attempted to forgo one while still using npm, babel, and other modern tools.
  1. You'll probably notice that I am using rollup-js. I had enough of learning why one wants a module bundler, so instead I tried a new one out instead of webpack.
